# Basic Concepts for Genealogical Standards

{.ednote ...} This is an **exploratory draft** of a standard covering 
basic concepts that are expected to be used in multiple FHISO standards.
This document is not endorsed by the FHISO membership, and may be
updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. 
{/}

FHISO's **Basic Concepts for Genealogical Standards** standard defines
various low-level concepts that will be used in many FHISO standards,
and whose definitions do not logically belong in any one particular
higher-level standard.

The definition of a *string* which is used in multiple FHISO standards
is given in §2 of this standard, together with various related concepts
such as *characters* and *whitespace*.

{.ednote} At present, this standard only includes definitions associated
with *characters* and *strings*.  It is anticipated that a future draft
will add definitions for *terms*, *datatypes* and *language tags*.

## Conventions used

Where this standard gives a specific technical meaning to a word or
phrase, that word or phrase is formatted in bold text in its initial
definition, and in italics when used elsewhere.
The key words **must**, **must not**, **required**, **shall**, 
**shall not**, **should**, **should not**, **recommended**,
**not recommended**, **may** and **optional** in this standard are to be
interpreted as described in
&#x5B;[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)].

An application is **conformant** with this standard if and only if it
obeys all the requirements and prohibitions contained in this
document, as indicated by use of the words *must*, *must not*,
*required*, *shall* and *shall not*, and the relevant parts of its
normative references.  Standards referencing this standard *must not*
loosen any of the requirements and prohibitions made by this standard,
nor place additional requirements or prohibitions on the constructs
defined herein.  

{.note} Derived standards are not allowed to add or remove requirements
or prohibitions on the facilities defined herein so as to preserve
interoperability between applications.  Data generated by one
*conformant* application must always be acceptable to another
*conformant* application, regardless of what additional standards each
may conform to. 

If a *conformant* application encounters data that does not conform to
this standard, it *may* issue a warning or error message, and *may*
terminate processing of the document or data fragment.

Indented text in grey or coloured boxes does not form a normative part
of this standard, and is labelled as either an example or a note.  

{.ednote} Editorial notes, such as this, are used to record outstanding
issues, or points where there is not yet consensus; they will be
resolved and removed for the final standard.  Examples and notes will be
retained in the standard.

The grammar given here uses the form of EBNF notation defined in §6 of
&#x5B;[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/)], except that no significance is
attached to the capitalisation of grammar symbols.  *Conforming*
applications *must not* generate data not conforming to the syntax given
here, but non-conforming syntax *may* be accepted and processed by a
*conforming* application in an implementation-defined manner.

## Characters and strings

**Characters** are specified by reference to their *code point* number
in [ISO 10646], without regard to any particular character encoding.  In
this standard, *characters* may be identified in this standard by their
hexadecimal code point prefixed with "U+".

{.note} The character encoding is a property of the serialisation, and
not defined in this standard.  Non-Unicode encodings are not precluded,
so long as it is defined how characters in that encoding corresponds to
Unicode characters.

*Characters* *must* match the `Char` production from
&#x5B;[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/)].

    Char  ::=  [#1-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]

{.note} This includes all *code points* except the null character,
surrogates (which are reserved for encodings such as UTF-16 and not
characters in their own right), and the invalid characters U+FFFE and
U+FFFF.

A **string** is a sequence of zero or more *characters*, and *should*
only be used to encode textual data.

{.note ...} This definition of a *string* is identical to the definition
of the `string` datatype defined in 
&#x5B;[XSD Pt2](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/)], used in many XML
and Semantic Web technologies.

This definition of a *string* differs very slightly from JSON's
definition of a string, as defined in 
&#x5B;[RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159)], as a JSON string
may include the null *character* (U+0000).  This is the only difference
between a JSON string and FHISO's definition of a *string*.  As a
*string* *should not* be used to contain raw binary data, this
difference is not anticipated to cause a problem.  If an application
needs to store binary data in *string*, it *should* encode it in a
textual form, for example with the Base64 data encoding scheme defined in 
&#x5B;[RFC 4648](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648)].
{/}

Applications *may* convert any *string* into Unicode Normalization Form
C, as defined in any version of Unicode Standard Annex #15 &#x5B;[UAX
15](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/)].

{.note} Normalization Form C and Normalization Form D allow easier
searching, sorting and comparison of *strings* by picking a canonical
representation of accented characters.  The conversion between
Normalization Forms C and D is lossless and therefore reversible, but
the initial conversion to either form is not reversible.  This allows a 
*conformant* application to normalise *strings* internally and not
retain the unnormalised form; however, an application doing so *must*
ensure the *string* is in Normalization Form C upon export, this being
the more usual form for use in documents.

*Characters* matching the `RestrictedChar` production from
&#x5B;[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/)] *should not* appear in
*strings*, and applications *may* process such characters in an
implementation-defined manner or reject *strings* containing them.

    RestrictedChar  ::=  [#x1-#x8] | [#xB-#xC] | [#xE-#x1F]
                           | [#x7F-#x84] | [#x86-#x9F]

{.note} This includes all C0 and C1 control characters except tab
(U+0009), line feed (U+000A), carriage return (U+000D) and next line
(U+0085).

{.example} As *conformant* applications can process C1 control
characters in an implementation-defined manner, they can opt to handle
Windows-1252 quotation marks in data masquerading as Unicode.
Applications *must not* treat non-ASCII characters (other than C1
control characters) as ANSEL, the character set properly used in [GEDCOM],
as [ANSEL]'s non-ASCII characters do not correspond to `RestrictedChar`s.

**Whitespace** is defined as a sequence of one or more space
*characters*, carriage returns, line feeds, or tabs.  It matches the
production `S` from &#x5B;[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/)].

    S  ::=  (#x20 | #x9 | #xD | #xA)+

**Whitespace normalisation** is the process of discarding any leading
or trailing *whitespace*, and replacing other *whitespace* with a single
space (U+0020) *character*.  

{.note}  The definition of *whitespace normalisation* is identical to
that in &#x5B;[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/)].

In the event of a difference between the definitions of the `Char`,
`RestrictedChar` and `S` productions given here and those in
&#x5B;[XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/)], the definitions in the
latest edition of XML 1.1 specification are definitive.
