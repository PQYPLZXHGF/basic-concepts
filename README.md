# Basic Concepts for Genealogical Standards

This repository contains drafts and miscellaneous other material for use
in a standard covering basic concepts that are not directly genealogical
in nature that are expected to be used in multiple [FHISO](http://fhiso.org/)
standards.  Comments or discussion of this work should take place on the
[**tsc-public** mailing list](http://tech.fhiso.org/tsc-public).
